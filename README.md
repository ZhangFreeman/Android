# Android
So this is my trainning project about Java and Android.
It is a client side application for Dribbble community.
The design is mainly refer to the homepage of it.

Unfortunately, the Dribbble community decided to turn off the api v1 and the new version does not support
for free view of the works on it(from the end of march 2018).
So this application is not able to use any more.

Fot that I uploaded some of the main feel of the application.
Take a look.
